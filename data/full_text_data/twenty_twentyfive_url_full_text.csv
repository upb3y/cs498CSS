Trump's presidency (assuming no impeachment) will last until either January of 2021 or January of 2025, meaning that (if there is no impeachment) Robert Mueller wouldn't expect to be able to take any case against Trump to trial until 2022 or 2026 *at the very, very earliest*."

And I'll credit POLITICO with this much: they were willing to have a philosophical conversation with me on the phone about how media is changing, and about how we may one day‚Äîbut *not yet*‚Äîbe at a point where major media can acknowledge online independent journalism publicly."

All my phone calls and emails with POLITICO were cordial‚Äîand I remain a fan of the publication. But what I know in my heart is *wrong* is for them to both not disclose these interactions with me *and* go online and attack me as a noncredible source of investigative reporting."

The right for anyone at POLITICO to question my credibility went out the window when they called my work ""urgent,"" remained in touch with me, and then begged me (and it really was something close to that) for my assistance, research, insight, and even my contacts in Greece."
